  Common birds in North America include the American Robin, 
  which has a red breast and yellow beak. The Blue Jay is 
  known for its bright blue feathers and loud calls. 
  Northern Cardinals are striking red birds often seen at feeders.
  The tiny Ruby-throated Hummingbird can hover and fly backwards.

instruction: |
  Return the bird at position {ordinal} from the input text, following these rules:

  1. Count birds in order of mention in the text.
  2. Return NO_MORE_ITEMS if {ordinal} is greater than the total number of birds.
  3. For a valid position, return the bird's details as a JSON object with:
    - name: Bird's name
    - colors: Array of actual colors (e.g. red, blue, yellow)
    - features: Array of traits and behaviors
    - location: Where it's found (if mentioned)

  For example, in:
  "The red robin flies fast. A blue jay calls loudly."
  Position 1 = red robin
  Position 2 = blue jay
  Position 3 = NO_MORE_ITEMS (exceeds total birds)

  Format: Either a single JSON object for the bird, or exactly "NO_MORE_ITEMS"
format: "json"
